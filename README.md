pythonGame

This is the readme for pythonGame, a text-based "Create Your Own Adventure" Game that is to be playable for those ages 13 and up. It was created as a part of a final project for INLS 560: Programming for Information Professionals at UNC Chapel Hill.

### The Storyline


### How To Play


### To Collaborators
The game is built with Python and has been tested with Ubuntu and ideone.com. Interested in the project? Want to collaborate with us? The game's content copyright 2013 Olivia Dorsey, Leslie Ho, and James Greer under a license. 

### Future Direction for pythonGame
We intend for the game to include more levels. We would also like to use Flaskr in order to eventually house our project and successfully integrate it with HTML and CSS via Skulpt so that it appears to the user in a more aesthetically-pleasing format.
